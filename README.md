## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Variables
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Focused on trying to practice DRY, Don't Repeat Yourself!
- Used CSS variables for the color
- Styled the button and the card as components first and then added extra class for the specfic color and content
- Started with using `<main>` as a kind of container for the card elements. Ran into trouble when trying to add a max-width for the cards in the desktop view. It is always better to have an extra container div when building a component like this that make be used in some other parts of a webpage. Make it easy for someone to copy this component over and keep things contained and named ðŸ˜‡

### Continued development

Made it through this challenge fairly quick which means chosing the layout, media queriers, adding padding/margins is becoming more intuitive ðŸ¥³
